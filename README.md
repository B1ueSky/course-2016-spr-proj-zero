# course-2016-spr-proj-zero
Test project repository for the Spring 2016 iteration of the Data Mechanics course at Boston University.

Suppose that you have two team members, `alice@bu.edu` and `bob@bu.edu` with the GitHub usernames `artemis` and `bacchus`. To complete this project, fork this repository and add a single directory with a name of the form `alice-bob` (ascending alphabetical order). For a single member, the directory name would simply be `alice`. Within the directory, add a single file `members.txt` containing the mappings from members' GitHub user names to their BU login names (one mapping per line).

For example, Alice and Bob would create a single file `./alice-bob/names.txt` with he following contents:
```
artemis:alice
bacchus:bob
```
